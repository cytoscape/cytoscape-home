# Cytoscape Home

Cytoscape Home is a web-based platform designed to help users transform raw data into interactive networks. It provides an intuitive and accessible environment for data analysis, collaboration, and publication. The platform is an essential part of the Cytoscape ecosystem, empowering users to easily explore, visualize, and share network-based data.

## Features

- **Data Import:** Upload raw data in various formats, including gene lists, Excel files, and CSVs, to create and explore networks.
- **Interactive Network Visualization:** Generate dynamic and interactive network visualizations that allow users to analyze relationships and patterns effectively.
- **Collaboration:** Enable collaboration among researchers and data analysts by sharing networks and results directly through the platform.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Cytoscape tools and software for enhanced functionality and deeper analysis.

## Cytoscape Ecosystem

Cytoscape Home is part of the broader Cytoscape ecosystem, which includes:

- **Cytoscape Desktop:** An open-source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating them with attribute data. Widely used in bioinformatics for tasks such as visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways.
- **Cytoscape.js:** A JavaScript library for graph theory modeling and analysis, used for building network visualization applications for the web.

## Use Cases

Cytoscape Home is ideal for:

- Visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways.
- Exploring relationships in large datasets for bioinformatics, social sciences, and more.
- Collaborating on network-based data with teams and organizations.

## Setup Guidelines

### Development Setup

To set up the development environment for Cytoscape Home, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure all required dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Build Commands:**

   Use the following commands based on your needs:

   ```bash
   npm run <target>
   ```

   Available targets:

  - `watch` or `dev`: Starts a local development server with live-reloading and automatic builds when changes are made to the source code.
  - `lint`: Runs ESLint to analyze the code for potential issues and ensures code consistency.
  - `build`: Creates an optimized production build, ready for deployment.

3. **Development Server:**

   To start the local development server, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will allow you to view and interact with the project in a web browser while actively developing.
